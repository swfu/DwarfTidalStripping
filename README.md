This is the Github repository accompanying Fu, Simon et al. 2018, which tests the tidal stripping scenario. Here, I include the code used in the Monte Carlo orbit analysis of Section 5. These notebook also include the results of the Monte Carlo orbit analysis for non-spherical halos. We find that flat halos correspond to increasingly large pericenter distances; thus, the major result of the paper is invariant to flattening.
