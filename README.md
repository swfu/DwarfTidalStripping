This is the Github repository accompanying Fu, Simon et al. 2018, which tests the tidal stripping hypothesis for the Crater II and Hercules dwarf galaxies. Here, we include the code used in the Monte Carlo orbit analysis presented in Section 5 of the paper. These notebooks also include the results of the Monte Carlo orbit analysis for non-spherical halos. We find that increasingly flat halos correspond to smaller pericenter distances; thus, the major result of the paper is invariaent to halo flattening.
