This is the Github repository accompanying Fu, Simon et al. 2018, which tests the tidal stripping hypothesis for the Crater II and Hercules dwarf galaxies. Here, we include the code used in the orbit analysis presented in Section 5 of the paper. These notebooks also include the results of the Monte Carlo orbit analysis for non-spherical halos. We find that increasingly flat halos correspond to smaller pericenter distances; thus, the major result of the paper is invariaent to halo flattening. 

Below are an explanation of each of the files in this repository: 

Notebooks:

* tidalradius.ipynb: Tidal radius calculations presented in Section 5.1 of the paper. 
* craII_analysis.ipynb: Orbit analysis of Crater II. These results are presented in Section 5.2 of the paper. 
* herc_analysis.ipynb: Orbit analysis of Hercules. These results are presented in Section 5.4 of the paper.

The PDF files in this repository are figures from the paper which were generated using the analysis presented in the notebooks.
